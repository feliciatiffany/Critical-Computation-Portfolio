            <p>This project involved designing and coding an experimental clock that challenges traditional methods of timekeeping. Moving beyond conventional units like seconds, minutes, and hours, I created a clock that represents time in a subjective, alternative, or unconventional way. This assignment encouraged expansive thinking about how time is experienced and expressed, resulting in a unique approach to marking the passage of time that goes beyond standard conventions.

            <h2>DESCRIPTION : </h2>
            
            <p>My experimental clock is called the Climate Clock. I’ve always wondered when people will finally wake up to the reality of climate change. When will we stop passing the blame and responsibility around, and actually take big, meaningful actions to address the problem? Will it only happen after disaster strikes? That’s where the idea came from—I wanted to show a leap in time between the past, present, and future to shake people into facing this reality.

                Eventually, I realized I wasn’t the only one thinking like this. In Union Square, there's a big climate clock, too. But with mine, I wanted to visually represent how the past, present, and potential future of the Earth might look if we don't take action. Sometimes, visuals speak louder than words when it comes to showing harsh truths. Even if I’m being a bit hyperbolic, I think it’s important to throw the reality out there, because no one really knows what the future holds.
                
                On a personal note, timers are super important in my life. I use them all the time to manage my schedule, stay on track, and be productive. So, I hope that by seeing this countdown for climate change, people will feel inspired to take action, just like how a timer pushes me to keep going.
