            <p>This project involved designing and coding an interactive game that reflects an aspect of my personal story. Using programming concepts like conditionals, loops, arrays, and object-oriented design, I created a game with a protagonist navigating through three scenes representing a beginning, middle, and end. The game combines visual storytelling, interactive design, and technical implementation to share a narrative that is uniquely mine. Focused on creativity and intention, this assignment allowed me to explore game design as a medium for self-expression.

            <h2>GAME DESCRIPTION :</h2>
           
            <p>Sunney represents how I view a human’s journey in life. We all know that life isn’t easy—it’s full of challenges and can be exhausting. But it’s our values and mindset that can make life more meaningful. If we look at life like a game, every passion and dream we pursue is like collecting points. That’s the idea behind this game. Sunney is a character chasing dreams and passions, just like we humans are the characters in our own stories. Specifically, Sunney is a reflection of myself—a character for my life’s story. The game consist of three stages represent three of some passions I discovered in my life: concerts/music, art, and technology. The sunflower as my favorite flower and sunsets as my favorite time, which I believe can symbolize the end of life, are also incorporated. Every part of this game is thoughtfully designed to reflect my journey. Beyond that, I hope this game inspires others to see life as a blessing filled with joy and mysteries worth exploring.</p>
