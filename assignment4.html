            <p>In this collaborative project, I worked with two partners to create an "exquisite corpse" figure, a surrealist-inspired composition divided into a head, upper body, and lower body. Each of us designed and coded a section of the figure without knowing what others created, resulting in a surprising and cohesive final piece. My contribution, coded using functions, focused on [your part, e.g., "the head with interactive elements"]. Motion, interaction, and animation were incorporated to bring the composition to life. The project highlights creative teamwork and the unpredictability of collaborative design.</p>

            <h2>DESCRIPTION : </h2>
            <h4>My partnerâ€™s name : Nadya and Sophia  </h4>
         
            <p>(I get Nana's Creature head, Sophia's Creature body, and use my own sketch lower body)</p>
            <h4>Background Story of Our Character : </h4>
                
            <p> Our character is an image of many people in the world today. Burdens and complicated things came and make us confused, sad, and disappointed. But we must keep fighting as we grow to overcome the obstacles and judgments of the world. When we are forever pondering and quietly navigating its world, we must also be able to acknowledge our negative conditions. To reflect, reduce overthinking, and accept ourselves for who we are. So at night this character always vents his emotions from what he experiences daily by being a hitman in Jump City. Like Batman who works at night, this character moves mysteriously and gives off quite a dark aura. However, in the end, humans are just humans. We always want to dream, hoping that the world will be better for us. Human will always have a positive side in them and a little light. This can be seen from this character's imagination when dreaming in his sleep. Like a child, he plays with his imagination to be free from the burden of the world.
